YAIM - Yet Another Image WUT?

This application is not an end-to-end solution.
I wanted to prove how I can handle concepts such as:
* MVP architecture, SOLID
* basic of DI and Reactive
* knowledge about modern android tech stack = libraries, tools, patterns

Features:
* can show images from Flickr feed
* can refresh
* offline - nothing happens

Libs
* LeakCanary 1.5 - to track and deal with memory leaks efficient
* Hugo 1.2.1 - (used during development) - fast and effortless logging mechanism
* Retrofit 2.1.0 
* Gson Converter 2.8.0 
* RxJava2 2.0.4
* RxAndroid 2.0.1
* RxAdapter 1.0.0
* Dagger2 2.7 - The only choice left. No reflection, fast.
* Retrolambda 3.3.1 - I didn't want to migrate to 1.8 and use Jack&Jill so I used it
* Glide 3.7.0 - recommended by Google, with very nice cache, simple.
* ButterKnife 8.4.0 - "A butter knife is like a dagger only infinitely less sharp." and because Jake did great work.
